The structure of an x86-64 (also known as AMD64 or Intel 64) executable file follows the Portable Executable (PE) format, which is the executable file format used by Windows operating systems. The PE format contains various sections that organize different types of data and code within the executable file. Here is a general overview of the structure:

1. DOS Header: This is a small header that contains DOS-specific information. It includes the DOS executable signature and an offset to the PE header.

2. PE Signature: This is a signature that marks the beginning of the PE-specific data.

3. COFF (Common Object File Format) File Header: This header contains information about the executable, such as the target machine type, number of sections, timestamp, and entry point.

4. Optional Header: This header contains additional information about the executable, such as the image base address, size of code and data sections, entry point address, and various flags and characteristics.

5. Section Headers: These headers define the characteristics and locations of each section in the executable. Common sections include the code section, data section, import section, export section, and resource section. Each section has a name, size, virtual address, and file offset.

6. Data Directories: These entries provide pointers to various data structures used by the executable, such as the import table, export table, resource table, exception handling table, and debug information.

7. Section Data: This is where the actual executable data resides, including the machine code, constant data, resources, and other relevant information. Each section is aligned and padded to meet memory alignment requirements.

8. Import Table: This table contains information about the functions and libraries that the executable imports for use. It includes the names and addresses of imported functions and the associated DLL (Dynamic Link Library) or shared library.

9. Export Table: This table contains information about functions or symbols that are exported by the executable and can be used by other programs or libraries.

10. Resource Table: This table contains embedded resources such as images, icons, strings, version information, and other types of data that the executable may use.

This is a simplified overview of the structure of an x86-64 executable file in the PE format. The actual format contains more detailed information and headers for additional functionality, such as exception handling, debugging, and runtime information.
